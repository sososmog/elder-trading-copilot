# Elder Trading Copilot

A context-aware intelligent trading assistant that combines an interactive backtesting dashboard with a RAG-powered chatbot, built around Alexander Elder's Triple Screen Trading System.

---

## Features

- **Interactive Backtest Dashboard** -- Adjust strategy parameters (EMA windows, RSI thresholds, breakout window, position sizing) via sidebar controls and see charts and metrics update in real time.
- **Three Linked Charts** -- Price with buy/sell signals, RSI with overbought/oversold zones, and equity curve versus buy-and-hold baseline, all sharing a synchronized x-axis.
- **Context-Aware RAG Chatbot** -- An embedded copilot panel that reads the current dashboard state (ticker, parameters, backtest results, risk level) and injects it into every prompt for tailored answers.
- **Dual LLM Support** -- Switch between Llama 3.3 70B via Groq (free, fast) and GPT-4o-mini via OpenAI (high quality) with a single dropdown.
- **877-Entry Knowledge Base** -- QA pairs extracted from Elder's books and video lectures, embedded with BGE and indexed in FAISS for sub-millisecond retrieval.
- **RAG Pipeline Explorer** -- A dedicated debug page that visualizes every stage of the pipeline: query embedding, chunk retrieval with metadata, assembled prompt, and timed LLM generation.
- **Quick Ask Buttons** -- One-click queries such as "Explain Setup", "Explain Perf", and "Risk?" for instant context-aware analysis.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later
- A Groq API key and/or an OpenAI API key

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/elder-trading-copilot.git
cd elder-trading-copilot

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
# venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set up API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your keys:
#   GROQ_API_KEY=gsk_...
#   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...

# 5. Build the FAISS index (one-time, ~30-60 seconds)
python build_index.py

# 6. Launch the application
streamlit run Dashboard.py
```

The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`. Use the sidebar to select a ticker and adjust strategy parameters; the copilot panel on the right answers questions with full dashboard context.

> **Note:** If `faiss_index/` already exists (included in the repo), you can skip step 5 and go straight to step 6.

## How It Works

### Backtest Engine

The backtest implements a simplified version of Elder's **Triple Screen Trading System**:

| Screen | Role | Condition (Long) | Condition (Short) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Screen 1 -- Trend | Filter direction | EMA Short > EMA Long | EMA Short < EMA Long |
| Screen 2 -- Momentum | Confirm strength | MACD > Signal line | MACD < Signal line |
| Screen 3 -- Entry | Time the trade | Close > N-day high | Close < N-day low |

All three screens must agree before a position is opened. Exits are triggered by RSI: long positions close when RSI exceeds the overbought threshold; short positions close when RSI drops below the oversold threshold.

Position sizing allocates a configurable percentage of available cash per trade (default 100%). The engine computes five metrics: Total Return, Sharpe Ratio, Max Drawdown, Trade Count, and Risk Level.

### RAG Pipeline

```
User Question
    |
    v
bge-small-en-v1.5 encodes the query into a 384-dim vector
    |
    v
FAISS IndexFlatL2 retrieves the top-k most similar chunks
    |
    v
Context Builder assembles:
  - System methodology (indicator formulas, trading logic)
  - Dashboard state (ticker, params, backtest metrics)
  - Retrieved knowledge chunks
  - User question + instructions
    |
    v
Llama 3.3 70B (Groq) or GPT-4o-mini (OpenAI) generates the answer
    |
    v
Response displayed in the copilot panel
```

The context-aware design means the chatbot can explain why a specific parameter setting produced a particular Sharpe ratio or drawdown, referencing both Elder's teachings and the live backtest data.

## Knowledge Base

The knowledge base contains **877 QA pairs** plus supplementary text, drawn from three sources:

| Source | Entries | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Base Knowledge Dataset | 635 | Elder strategy, risk management, psychology, timing, adaptability |
| *The New Trading for a Living* | 50 | Hand-extracted QA on MA, RSI, MACD, Triple Screen, risk rules |
| *Study Guide for Come Into My Trading Room* | 100 | Auto-extracted QA pairs from the study guide |
| Elder video lecture transcript | ~15 chunks | `elder_new_high_new_low.txt`, split at 400 chars with 50-char overlap |

QA pairs are not chunked further -- each question-answer pair is embedded as a single unit so that the question portion aids retrieval while the answer provides the knowledge.
